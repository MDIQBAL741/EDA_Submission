The dataset contained information on hotel bookings, including booking dates, customer demographics, and reservation details. First, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, which involved removing missing values, handling duplicates. Then we visualized the data using various graphical techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps. Through our analysis, we discovered several interesting insights. For example, we found that most bookings were made between july and August."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Have you ever considered the ideal season of the year to reserve a hotel room?
